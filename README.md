PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.
i have used here regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
